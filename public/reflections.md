# Reflections!
## Made by Varnashree Karthikeyan of 9-Cesium

### Topics I know very well:
1. VSCode Introduction - I find vscode fun to use.  There are a lot of tutorials online and I can keep my files organized on it.  I would like to use it for whatever future job I have.
2. Variable Declaration - I found it simple because we already had practice in prior classes.  I'm familiar with declaring variables already after learning C++ and Python.  I also find it nice that variables are able to be reassigned more easily.
3. Arithmetic Operators - They are similar to the operators used in C++.  Additionally, they are also easy to remember due to knowing basic math.  I know how to use them accordingly in exercises.
4. Input and Output - We used a lot of input and output functions in C++.  For example, when getting input from the user.  I find it simple compared to other lessons.
5. For loops - For loops, in my opinion, are much more organized than while loops.  They're also easier to manipulate.  I like how I can use them in a lot of exercises.

### Topics I need further practice on:
1. Functions - I had trouble with remembering premade functions.  Additionally, I often forget to call the function.  I'm also not so good at manipulating it and inputting it into different parts of my code.
2. While loops - I understand the syntax, but I have trouble with the application.  Sometimes I would code it wrong or mix up variables.  I just find them hard to look at and I have trouble with manipulating variables in them as well.
3. Number methods - I had trouble with knowing when to use which.  There were so many, and I could only remember a few of them.  Additionally, I sometimes mixed them up which messed up my code at times.
4. Switch statements - They're supposedly simple, but sometimes I forget how to write them.  For example, I was mostly unsure whenever I wrote my conditions when I did switch statements.  I also find them a bit overwhelming, and whenever I make a mistake while coding them, it usually takes me a while to find it.
5. Formatting - By formatting, I mean things like buttons and adding spaces, etc.  It took me a while to figure out how to place spaces in between parts of my code.  It was tough for me because the new parts sometimes conflicted with my code or confused me.

### Plan of Action:
#### To resolve these, I plan to practice more.  I will also reread the lessons and review the tools given to us in our KHub for cs.  I will also try to ask my friend for help since they have experience in coding, and I also plan to review online solutions for coding problems online so that I can better my understanding of JS syntax.  Additionally, I will try to get more practice in with both console log and HTML so that I'm used to both of them, so that I'm prepared for new exercises.

### Useful Activities:
#### I think that the "Weird Condition" Exercise and the 6th Graded Exercise  were both useful.  The Weird Condition exercise gave me more practice on things like arithmetic operators.  It also helped me practice more on applying things that I learned in C++ to Javascript/Console log.  Looking back, I could've reviewed my code in the 6th GE to review for the LT, but the fibonacci sequence in general confused me and I didn't know how to translate it in code.  Additionally, the 6th GE gave me more practice in while loops.

### Ineffective Activities:
#### Personally, I think that the 3rd Graded Exercise and the 7th Graded Exercise did not help me understand the course lessons so much.  The 3rd GE was confusing for me and I can't really recall any other activities where we used what we did in that one.  The 7th Graded Exercise felt out of nowhere and I really struggled doing it, and I understand if it was supposed to help us review for newer lessons, but I would've liked for a guide or another sort of review before doing that.
